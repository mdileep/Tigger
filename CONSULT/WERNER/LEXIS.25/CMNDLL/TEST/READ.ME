Here's the latest in TEST2 and the Common DLL...

****  CMNDLL V1.00.065 *****


o  BmpBtn window class now draws both up and down bitmaps in the 
   "same place" if both are specified.  This means that it is much 
   easier to create bitmaps.

   If only an up bitmap is specified, then the up bitmap is used for 
   both the up and down bitmaps.  The bitmap _WILL_ be drawn down
   and right 2 pixels (just like before).

o  The status line now generates WM_COMMAND messages on a double click.

   wParam
          The child window control ID of the status line.
          This is specified in the CreateWindow call.

   HIWORD(lParam)   
          The ID of the stat box (0 is first, 0xFFFF is the message
          box).

   HIWORD(lParam)
          Any combination of the following values:

                MK_CONTROL - Control key was down.
                MK_SHIFT   - Shift key was down.
                MK_LBUTTON - Left button double clicked.
                MK_RBUTTON - Right button double clicked.
                MK_MBUTTON - Middle button double clicked.

   See TEST2 for an example.

o  The atoi function has been renamed to AtoI to prevent conflict with
   the C runtime function.  I still haven't been able to figure out 
   why I don't get the 'char FAR*' version....

*****  CMNDLL V1.00.052 *****

o  First _real_ version.
