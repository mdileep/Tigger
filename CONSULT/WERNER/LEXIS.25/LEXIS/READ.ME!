This file contains the latest information on Lexis 2000 2.5 for Windows.

The latest and greatest information will be added to the file as the
project continues.

Read this file BEFORE you run the latest version.  This way you won't
get your hopes up too high when you see something that appears to 
be broken.

NOTE:  READ THIS!!!:

   BEFORE RUNNING A "NEW" VERSION, MAKE SURE YOU DELETE ALL PREVIOUS
   VERSIONS OF "CMNDLL.DLL" FROM YOUR PATH!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.132            Date: 3/18/91

Selecting text is almost finished.  The current implementation 
"flickers"...that will be fixed.

Added LEXPRNT.DLL.  This is the printing module.  The File.Print... 
functions all now work.

Choose the "Sign On/Off Lexis..." menu item.  The "connect" dialog box
has been implemented.  Notice the "LED" lights and "Stop sign" button.

This version comes with CMNDLL Version 1.00.179.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.120            Date: 3/10/91

Added right mouse button support (i.e. Right mouse button moves cursor
to where the mouse was clicked).

Most of the printing code is implemented....but there's nothing to
print at this point.

Much of the logic for selecting text and pasting it to the clipboard
is implemented.  There are some wrinkles still, however.  Thus the
selection mechanism is disabled in this release.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.118            Date: 3/6/91

Fixed bug 0.00.112:0001 (Menu mnemoics).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.113            Date: 3/4/91

There was an "OutputDebugString()" call in the Directories dialog box.
If you ran version 0.00.109 or 112 on a system without a terminal
connected to COM1 you would get an "Error writing to device AUX" 
message when the Directories dialog box exited.  This version fixes
this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.112            Date: 3/4/91


Fixed scrolling problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.109            Date: 3/4/91

Added terminal window.

  Implemented:
        Caret tracking (i.e. caret moves outside of visible window,
           I track it and make it visible)
        Word wrap.
        Scrolling.
        Changing colors/fonts in UserPrefs...
        Cursor movement keys.

  Not yet Implemented:
        Insert mode.
        Character attributes (primary and secondary).
        Selection (i.e. with mouse)

Added System Error dialog boxes.  These dialog boxes will pop up
if anything serious goes wrong.  The dialog box indicates the
source code module and line number that the error was generated
from.  THIS IS FOR TESTING ONLY.  If you encounter one of these
dialog boxes please report all relevent information to me.
        
Comes with CMNDLL.DLL Version 1.00.160.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.062             Date: 2/24/91

Updated all menu "Quick Help" strings so they are more complete and
explainatory. 

Fixed "clipping" message line problem.

Finialized the Help menu.  For a good example of how the help system will
be implemented see Excel 3.0.  Added some Help functionality.  The
LEXIS.HLP file is not ready yet, so I just call up WINHELP.HLP for
now.

Added "page setup" dialog box.

Finished "User preferences"  It now paints a sample, and the font 
info is stored in the INI file.

Implemented "Connection Setup" dialog.  This includes the "Modem 
setup" and the "Networks" dialogs.  The "Connector" dialog will
be supplied when the communications drivers are implemented.

Note that some of the functinality in the dialog boxes is not implemented
yet.

Made several cosmetic changes.

Comes with CMNDLL.DLL Version 1.00.158.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.059             Date: 2/23/91

I have added the "File" dialog boxes.  There are some refinements 
needed, but this will come.

To make the File dialog boxes (File.New, File.Open, File.Print) work
correctly use the File.Setup.Directories dialog to set the default 
directories to a "real" directory.  (This is only needed if you
do not have a C:\LEXIS directory).  Note that this WILL NOT be 
hard coded this way...it was done so here for testing purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.056             Date: 2/22/91

This version has been tested thoroughly in all operating modes of Windows
on all hardware I have available to me.  

More dialog box functions have been added, the menu's have been fixed up,
and the bottom status line now shows the status of the Record, Diary,
and Print functions.  

Note that currently there is no code to turn on and off the new status
indicators.  That functionality will come into play when the associated
functions are implemented.

The "File.Setup.Directories" dialog box has been implemented.

The "File.Setup.Printer" dilog box has been implemented.

The "File.Setup.User Preferences" dialog box has undergone some changes,
but is still not 100% there.

This version comes with CMNDLL.DLL Version 1.00.155.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.050             Date: 2/12/91

The main change in this version is the modification of the User 
Prefereneces dialog box.  A "Select Font" dialog box was added for
the Normal Font and the Hightlight Font.

Note that the User Preferences dialog box does not implement the "sample"
yet.  Also note that the Select Font dialog box does not implement 
color selection yet either.

When switching from one Personality to another, I have sped up the
window redraws.  

Fixed several "Real Mode" bugs.  Note that there may still be some 
problems in Real Mode when using an EMS driver.  I wanted to get this
version to you quickly and tracking down the problems in Real Mode is
VERY time consuming.

Note that this Version comes with CMNDLL Version 1.00.152.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.043             Date: 2/06/91

Completed "3 GUIs".  Added User Preferences dialog box.  Notice the 
new and improved menu layout in the "File"  menu.  This should make 
the File menu easier to read and use for the user.  

Use the "File.Setup.User Preferences" menu item to change the 
"Personality" of LEXIS between the 3 (LEGAL, CORP, and COMBINED).
You can also turn on/off the button bar, top status bar, and 
bottom bar.  

NOTE!: The Font selection has been moved from the "Formats" menu to
this dialog box.  Also note that I haven't implemented this yet
(that's why the list boxes are empty)...

Moved the buttons closer together.  I think I like this better.  It 
takes less screen real estate and makes the groupings clearer.

Added one pixel above the text in a stat box on the status bars. 
This gives it a little more "even" look, without making it too tall.

Modified layout of the about box.  This is a little more consistant
looking.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.025             Date: 1/28/91


Fixed font problems on Mike's machine (i hope).  Fixed UAE problem with
the time and date routines when the [Intl] section of WIN.INI had not
been intialized.

Made button font smaller and non-bold.  Also changed colors a little
bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Version: 0.00.022             Date: 1/28/91

This is the first version that I'm going to let anyone see.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING COMPLETELY BEFORE RUNNING IT!!!

Here's what's there and what isn't:


- MAIN WINDOW
   When you start L2000 2.5 for the first time, it will place itself
   at a "default" position on the screen.  Then from that time forward
   whenever you exit L2000, it will save it's LAST screen position and
   when it's started again it will come up in that position.

   It even remembers if it was maximized or not.  For instance let's
   say you had it open at x = 10, y = 56, xsize = 600, and ysize = 323, 
   and you close it down.  Then you start it up again.  It will come
   up at 10,56,600,323.  

   Then let's say you maximize it.  Ok, so now it's full screen.  Now
   you quit again.  Next time you run it, it will be maximized!  But 
   let's say you hit the "restore" arrow...  The window will go to 
   where you think it should:  10,56,600,323!

- MENU
   The menu "message" tracking is all there.  The only menu item
   that actually does anything is the "About..." menu item under
   the Help menu.  

- TOP STATUS BAR
   This was formerly called the InfoBar in 1.7.  In the a later version
   you will be able to double click on this bar and pop up the "Change
   Client" and "Change Libaray" dialog boxes".  

- BOTTOM STATUS BAR
   This was formerly called the status line in 1.7.  Double click
   on the various boxes to see that it acts like a button.  Note 
   the status bars DO NOT depress when you click on them, they only
   send the appropriate messages.  

   MESSAGE BOX
     The idea is for the "message box" (the part that say's "Offline",
     and tracks the menu items) to serve as a means for the user to get
     quick help (i.e. double click on that part and he/she'll get the
     help system).


     Note that the menu's are ALL tracked in the message part, including
     the system menu!

   NUM and CAPS BOXES
     These two boxes track the status of the NUM and CAPS lock keys.
     Note the COLOR of these strings!  I can change them _easily_
     to make anyone happy.
        
   DATE BOX
     The date is displayed here in Window's "Long" date format.  To
     see how super cool this is, go to the control panel and change
     the "Long" date format (in international) to something 
     different while L2000 2.5 is running (you have to OKay your
     way out of the International dialog boxes in CtrlPanel for this
     to work).

   CD BOX
     This shows the Carrier Detect Status....

- BUTTON WINDOW
   As you can see this is cool <grin>.  While these buttons may 
   _look_ like normal Windows buttons, think again...These buttons
   are of my own "bmpbtn" class.  What does this mean?

        1) I can change the color at will.  (There are four colors
           to each button: Text, FocusText, Face, and Shadow).

           Note how the yellow button's shadow is a "dark" yellow!

        2) See how the font looks a little smaller than the "normal"
           system font?  I can change the font of the buttons to
           any font Windows can display.  I'll show you others
           in later versions.

        3) By simply changing some strings in the application's
           resources (i.e. without changing _ANY_ code, I can 
           make bitmaps appear in those buttons.  You've seen
           TEST2.EXE's buttons...

   KEYBOARD INTERFACE
     I've implemented fully the keyboard interface for the buttons
     as we discussed it on the phone.  When you are in the terminal
     window (which doesn't really exist yet) or other child window
     you can hit the TAB key to get into the button window.  Then
     hit TAB, UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT, HOME, END, PAGEUP, and PAGEDOWN
     to move from button to button.  SHIFT-TAB off the "first button"
     (i.e. "Transmit") and you'll return to the main window, TAB off
     the "last button" and you'll return to the main window.

     Cool, huh?

     While any button has the focus notice the following:

        1)  It is highlighted by a different text color
        2)  Pressing SPACE causes it to be "pressed"
        3)  Pressing ENTER causes the "Transmit" button to be pressed!
   
That's about it.  Let me know what you think!
