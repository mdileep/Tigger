The scroll bar across the top of the window shows thumbnail sketches for each clip-art image in the library you have selected.  They have MUCH less detail than the actual clip-art, and do not show color if applicable.  Select a thumbnail by clicking on it with the mouse or by moving the highlight with the +/- keys.  These images are copyright protected.

** A line drawn underneath a series of thumbnails indicates that the whole set will be downloaded together for one purchase price!  The individual images may be separated after you receive them.

The DOWNLOAD button lets you view prices and available file formats, and purchase the clip-art image represented by the thumbnail.

Some libraries are divided into sublibraries.  You select among them by clicking the mouse on the sublibrary name in the Sublibrary listbox near the lower-left corner of the window.  IMAGES IN SUBLIBRARY indicates how many pieces of clip-art are contained in the selected sublibrary.

You may order the library (including all sublibraries) from the main screen by pressing the ORDER LIBRARY button.$
