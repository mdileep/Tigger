If you are being prompted for a User ID, then enter the User ID on the sticker on your Window Shopper User's Manual.

Make up a password (five to eight characters or digits; no punctuation or blanks) and type it in the password field.  Pick something that no one could easily guess; an odd made-up word works well.  The password is case insensitive, which means it does not distinguish between capital and lowercase letters.
 
WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD AND KEEP IT IN A SAFE, PRIVATE PLACE!  You will need your password every time you logon to the Adonis Server.  If you lose or forget it, there will be a delay for Adonis to find it (you must request your password in writing to Adonis).  Anyone who learns your password and who has access to your computer would be able to charge purchases to your credit card.

A Note to those who are re-installing Windows and/or Window Shopper and have previously completed the New User process and logged in:  You MUST enter the same password you originally used to logon.  Enter your password and continue on with the New User process, updating and correcting your customer information as needed.  You will need to re-enter your credit information.$
