   SPECIAL NOTES FOR DEMO USERS

   Retail packages of Clip-Art Window Shopper come with a collection of disks which are not included with the demo.  These disks contain the preview images, or "Thumbnails" of the actual clip-art.  With the large thumbnail collection contained in our package (your "local cache") you can browse through 20,000+ popular images without using your telephone and modem.  

   Members usually connect to the system only to confirm prices, place orders, and download images.  Members also connect to the system to the newest thumbnail images which have been added to the Server since their purchase.  (There is no charge other than your long-distance telephone charge).

   The Demo diskette comes with a limited subset of thumbnail images:  the Volume 1 library from ArtRight.  These thumbnails were installed on your hard disk (in your "thumbnail cache") when you installed Window Shopper.  You can Logon and view all other thumbnails if you wish.

   Window Shopper is your passport into the wide world of clip-art!  Please contact Adonis Customer Service at 1-800-234-9497 with any questions. $
