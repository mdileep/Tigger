This screen prompts you for your password and gives you the opportunity to use a different User ID.  

Normally you shouldn't use a different User ID from the one displayed, so simply press ENTER to get to the PASSWORD field.  Only enter a different User ID if you know of another Window Shopper account which you would like to use and you know the corresponding password.

The Password is case insensitive, which means it does not distinguish between capital and lowercase letters.$
