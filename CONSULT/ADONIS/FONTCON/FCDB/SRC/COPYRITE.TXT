The fonts ("the Fonts") made available for downloading on the The Font Connection service are the copyrighted works of their publishers.  By use of the Service to electronically transfer ("download") an individual Font, whether or not for a fee, You acknowledge and agree that this constitutes acquisition of a license from the Publisher to use that Font, which use shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

i)    You MAY use the Font solely for the purpose of incorporation into Your original published material.  You may copy the Fonts into any machine-readable or printed form, or merge them into another program for this purpose only.  Any part of the Font merged into another program will continue to be subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

ii)   You MAY NOT sublicense, lease, rent, lend, trade, or sell the license obtained from the Publisher of the Fonts.

iii)  You MAY NOT reproduce any of the Fonts in any form for the purpose of selling, leasing, transferring, or assigning the unaltered Fonts in substantially the same form as the Fonts are provided by the Publisher.

iv)   You agree to use Your best efforts and take all reasonable steps to protect the Fonts from unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution.

v)    Your license shall be in effect until terminated.  The License will be terminated by the Publisher if You fail to comply with any of the terms of this License.  You can terminate the License by destroying all copied, modified and merged versions of the Fonts extant in any form.

Except as expressly permitted above, You may not commercially exploit or reproduce, redistribute, retransmit, publish, or otherwise transfer any information or intellectual property which You receive through The Font Connection.
