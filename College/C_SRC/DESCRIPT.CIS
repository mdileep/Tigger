Tales from the Runtime #2 - Getting Your Feet Wet
This article modifies the source code from Turbo C's runtime
library in order to add a feature to expand wildcard characters
('*' and '?'). This follows the Unix convention for expanding
wildcards. Once the changes are made to the runtime source, this
feature is available to all of your Turbo C programs.
