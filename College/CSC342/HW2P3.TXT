Queue Routines:

Status = ClearQueue (Queue)
Status = EnQueue (Queue, Element)
Status = DeQueue (Queue, Element)
Status = Empty (Queue)


Algorithm for level ordered transversal of a binary tree:


LevelOrder (Btree : binarytreetype)
begin
  if Btree exists
    if Btree.right exists
        EnQueue (Q, BTree)
    LevelOrder (BTree.left)
    LevelOrder (Btree.right)

end
