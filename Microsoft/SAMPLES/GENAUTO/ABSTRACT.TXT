ABSTRACT

GenAuto is my version of "GENERIC".   Like ColSamp, GenAuto is a Full Server that implements an automation object model.   Unlike ColSamp, GenAuto does not have any significant implemenation in it's C*Doc and C*View classes.

The key thing that GenAuto demonstrates is the implementation of a Documents collection on the Applicaiton object.   Therefore from VBA you can do:

    Dim a As Object
    Dim d As Objects
   
    Set a = CreateObject("GenAuto.Application.1")

    n = 1
    For Each d in a.Documents
         d.Title = "Doc #" + Str$(n)
         n = n + 1
    Next

Someday I'll probably add a Windows collection that enumerates all the active CViews (given the implementation of CDocuments as a base this would be trivial).
