In recent discussion on rust removal and prevention,I believe the most
important aspect has not been mentioned.As an ex-chemist who worked in the
field of rust removal and prevention,I have found that most people working
in the field of autobody repair have no concept of how to prepare metal for
painting.
If one assumes that the steel has been totally cleaned,i.e has no paint,oil,
grease,tar or rust on the surface,then in a normal environment-with moisture
in the air-rusting has already started.The next step is to wash the surface
with about 25% Phosphoric Acid.(Rubber gloves and eye protection)
This will do two things.
        a) Convert any rust to iron phosphate
        b) Attack the surface of the metal and create a fine layer of iron
phospate which can be seen as crystals with a magnifying glass.These
crystals are molecularly bonded to the metal.
Do not wash excess acid off with water.Let the acid dry.It is normal when
acid is in excess, that a gel like deposit can be formed.Wash this with a
rag dipped in more acid.When all is dry the surface will have a dark grey
appearance.Apply the primer of your choice directly to the metal.
One of the major advantages of a phosphated surface is that if the finished
painted surface is scratched,whilst it will rust,the rusting will not spread
under the paint system in a chain reaction,which is what happens when primer
is applied to bright metal.
I hope the above is of value.Please don't hesitate to e-mail me if you have
any questions.   Jack
