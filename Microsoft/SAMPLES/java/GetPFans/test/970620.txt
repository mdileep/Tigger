Guys,
Will a decrease in exhause (muffler) backpressure increase performance
or horsepower?  What are the considerations?  If you decrease
backpressure, what other system is affected that needs adjustement for
best performance?  Or is a decrease in backpressure always good??

It feels a bit to strong of a vibration to be just the 2.5 four.  BTW, 86

Too bad that a driver/owner of Foyt's skill and great historical

suppose he will come armed and just shoot the guy.....

I am sorry, but I get a bit disgusted at the antics of some of our

Cheap is a relative term...get the parts that do the job right the first time,
even if they are more expensive, and you will save in the long run. 
Automotion is a good source for parts, as well as Automobile Atlanta.

>My odometer doesn't work.  The speedometer does.  Is this a common

If I remember correctly, a great repair shop is North Hollywood
Speedometer (or something like that).  I can research that and send you
info off-line, if you prefer.

>The gas gauge jumps.  When it does, it is off about a quarter tank. 
>What is up with this?

This sounds like a common 924 problem - poor electrical grounding.  It
may also affect your temp gauge.  People at Automotion or Automobile
Atlanta should have ground upgrading kits that will improve this situation.

>The filter sucks air through a small hole.  Should I modify the "air

NO!  The air intake was designed to take in cool, outside air from the
fender inlet area.  If you cut it off, you will take in hot, under hood air and
reduce your performance.

I would personally stay away from fiberglass, as it is non-original and
that sounds too cheap to really address the rust issue.  A professional
body shop estimate of the extent of the problem is a good start point. 
One other idea to check is if you have a plugged drain tube for the A/C. 
If so, the drain tray will overflow into the passenger footwell.

The motors are not cheap, but since you have no glass right now, you
should be able to check the function of the motor.  To the best of my
knowledge, the mounting for the mirror glass should center itself in the
housing.

Automotion will have the seals, as should any competent dealer...

Not a generic part.  I don't remember exactly, but the cost from the dealer
is <$100.
 
>My front wheels seem wobly.  It seems to be that the struts woble,
>although they seem to compress correctly.  Will replacing them give me

Wobble could be from bad wheel bearings.  Replacing struts with Konis
or equivalent will improve handling.  Remember, suspension components
are linked, so improving one area may lead you to upgrading other areas.

>Are there any ways to really boost the performance inexpensivly?  I

In my experience, without spending dramatic sums of money, it is difficult
to improve the performance of the 924 in a really measurable manner.  It
is a good all around car, but is down on horsepower.

>I have heard something about being able to put disk breaks from a super
>beattle onto the back of the 924.  Is this possible?  Is it easy?

No experience with VW conversions, but Porsche did make versions of
the 924 with 4wheel disc brakes.  This would be the preferred
conversion.

>Do 924s come stock with anti-sway bars?  If not, are they a
>worth-while upgrade?

If memory serves me correctly, they came with a front bar, but not rear. 
As to upgrading, it depends on your objective.  You can sink a lot of
money into the car and make it do almost anything you want, or you
could sell, and invest the proceeds and the projected upgrade cost into a
good used 944 :)  Based on my experience, this would be the preferred
path to improved performance.

If the car doesn't seem right, pass on it... there are plenty of others
available.  See above comment regarding upgrade paths.

Most worthwhile is membership in Porsche Club of America.  PCA gives
you access to a lot of great resources, can get you discounts on parts
and another support group and activities for you and your trusty mount.

A little tip!
For years now I've watched various folks use a piece of 2x4 to cushion their
jacks as they raise their 944s and/or 911s. I too used this until I went
with even lower profile tires; I found the 2x4 just a bit too big to get
under my lowered 944 and searched around for a substitute.  I found a HOCKEY
PUCK.  I now prefer it to the wood in virtually all circumstances.  It fits
nicely on the jack and under the jack pads.  Give it a try.

Lighten up, Farzaan. Sounds like you're going thru an insecure phase, your
identity is getting too wrapped in your car, and you're depending on other
peoples' opinions to tell you what to drive.  Everyone feels your car needs
more personality?  Come on! What is it that YOU want out of a car. Doesn't
seem like you're concerned about making good runs on the track anymore.
There's no end to the path you're on now.  You're getting dangerously close
to becoming a shallow snob. Pull out of the dive before you have me
thinking that I can't really be content until I get a 911 too.

Flip side. Relax. Drive the C2. If you like it, get it. No biggie. 

Anyway. Enough preaching. For what it's worth, I recently had a great price
on an excellent '86 Carrera.  Decided to keep my S2 because I happen to
like driving it more than the 911. Don't get me wrong. That black Carrera
was a beautiful and serious machine.  But it's not the only "real" Porsche.

And then...

Put a 6 mm short bolt in the hockey puck, so the bolt head protrudes.
This will fit nicely in the recess in the jack seat under the door. The
puck will then be less prone to slide. The puck is so soft  that a 5 mm
hole (please convert to your favourite measurement system, please!) will
be just about right. 

Happy jacking!

The high technology is a big part of the problem for F1. Everything is
so expensive that there are only a few teams with the resources to win.
Remove Ferrari and Williams, and who stands a chance? In NASCAR, since
everyone is on equal footing (more or less) the cost of a competitive
car is about 100K, there are lots of competitive teams. You never
know who is going to win until the race is over.

F1 is the premier motorsport category in the world to compare its long
proud history that dates back to the very first Grand Prix at Le Mans
with knuckle dragging NASCAR races amazes me. I imagine we would not be
debating this if Porsche still had a F1 interest.

The IRL????!?!?!?  What, a two year history, amateur hour league is now
being
compared, indirectly, with F1?  I think you are missing the difference
in 
technology between NASCAR and Formula One.  It's not even close.  As for
cojones--how about driving a CART open wheel racer with 900 turbocharged
horses at average speeds of almost 230mph on a superspeedway?

Fellow P-fans,   do any of you have the part no. for the air bleed sticker
that is on the intercooler tube on the 951? The sticker is to the left of the
air filter housing when you are standing in front of the car. I know it is a
little thing, but it might help out on the road sometime. Thanks,  Colin F.

One thing you may want to check is the cabling from the alternator and Starter
motor. This passes very close to the exhaust manifold and can cause the cabling
to melt and fuse. It happened to me, Starter motor engaged as I was driving, 
ended up replacing the starter motor (which melted internally) and the
alternator, Together with a large section of wire. The cables are now protected
with some Heat Shroud I got of a plumber, used to insulate boiler pipes.

This only happens on 924's , the 924T (931) has a different engine
configuration.

Good luck with your new purchase!

Richard.

Hi,
	I've got an 89 944S2, and the tachometer has started having problems.  
When the car is off, it stays at about 900, and is slowly creeping up, to a little
over 1000,  It works okay when the car is running, but appears to be too high.
Is there any adjustment for it?  Or should it be replaced? 
	Thanks for any help.

Many thanks for all of your emails regarding that dopey winding motor sound
that I've benn experiencing for about 4 days now.

  Things suggested were:
     
       a) Alt bearings
       b) power steering pump
       c) water pump
       d) the cat that I ran over last week
    

       Well folks...at this point it's up to the wrench dream team, cause I
brought her in this morning. I'll be happy to let you all know what it
was....

        Right now, all I can seem to think about
is....MO-MONEY....MO-MONEY.....
MO-MONEY....
        (and hoping my lovely wife is in a good mood when I tell her about
it...it could be a LONG weekend....)

I have posted several messages about brake pads and it looks like
metalmasters are the winner.  I have two additional questions though.  Are
there slots in the metalmasters for the wear sensors?  And, the local
dealer tells me not to have the rotors turned or they will warp.  They are
not worn badly but there is a lip on the edge.  Is the dealer correct????

Thanks!

Just kidding. Hope it doesn't hurt too much, but remember, even if it does,
it would most likely hurt a lot more if you waited to have it fixed.

Howdy,

That was a great post Nick!  I got a few emails from the people that I really
wanted to hear from yesterday and they gave some pointers and some encouragement.
So, I've still got the test drive planned for Monday of the RS America (there
are no C2's for sale around town right now to drive so the RS America is the
closest I can come to a C2), but I got a chance to sit in a C2 Tip that's for sale.
Hmmm... how to say it nicely... they charged $100,000 for that interior when it
was new?  Did you guys know the rear window defogger button is like a cigar
lighter plug?  But, I still didn't mind that (thoughts that go through your
head are: "well, the driving experience must make up for all of this".  What
I did mind was cheezy materials used on the roof panel and the door panels,
and even the center console (maybe it's only for the Tip models that have this
elephant-hyde-look plastic).  But, I am not putting down the C2, I like all
Porsches, but the interior really is a step backwards from the 951.

I also decided to take the 951 for a HARD boot and try out different chips
again to see the differences.  I still like the smoothness of my chips, but
Paul's APE's have more low end (always tradeoffs!).  What I did find was that
this car has A LOT of personality at WOT, it's just too bad you drive too
fast at WOT everywhere :)  I actually took a corner down a back road that
stunned me a bit.  I went into this corner really hard and floored it through
the corner, the tail stepped out, so I eased the throttle back and it started
to understeer, stand on it again and oversteer, then ease off just a touch
and a 4-wheel drift.  Hmmmm... that sure did feel good.  Now, if only I
could do that on the track!

I think all that my car needs is a bit of uniquness, maybe just an exhaust or
cat-con bypass or a lip spoiler or maybe a 968 Turbo S wing with front winglets,
something to set it apart from all the others at the events.

My compressor bypass valve should be coming soon, that will give it some
personality for sure.

Farzaan.

<snip> cheap looking interiors

I'm not sure if I posted this to the group before or not but here goes
again.  My brother-in-law has a Ferrari 308 GTSi that he club races.  I got
to drive the car a while back and was floored by the acceleration and
handling.  But, the interior really looked cheesy.  I mentioned this to him
and his comment was that in Ferrari circles it is said that you buy the
driveline and chassis and get the rest for free!  Always thought that was
funny!

Michael

btw, the 911 has always been my dreams car and I still plan to own one in
the future. But if a snobby 911 person comments that I don't own a real
Porsche, I might just have to pull an AJ Foyt on him  : )

I hate to admit it, but I too would like my S2 to sound a bit nastier on
the track, even if an exhaust mod doesn't improve the power.  B&B Fab has
some nice, but expensive, systems for the 944s.  Both a cat-back and a test
pipe. One of my PCA friends w/ a 944S claims he's got a B&B system in which
the test pipe comes in two pieces. The forward piece bolts to the exhaust
manifold and ends just beyond the 02 sensor. The back half attaches to the
exhaust pipe. If the regular converter pipe were similarly modified, it be
convenient to change over before track events - wouldn't have to go thru
the hassle unbolting at the exhaust manifold.

Windward sells some of the B&B products for about half the price quoted by B&B. 

 If you modify the exhaust, let me know what you think.  Time to pay back
those noisy 911 and 914 drivers that give me earaches when I work the
corners.  A few extra hp would be icing on the cake.

I may not grasp the situation completely, but I do know who AJ Foyt is
(or was).

This is what I think:

Professional racing at top level (NASCAR, f1, whatever) means, among
many other things, checking the car with telemetrics, keeping track of
all competition and generally being informed about just everything...    
If Aries team knew the right number of laps, and could prove it, I think
AJ:s team knew too... In that case they entered the winning circle well
aware that the race maybe wasn't quite over yet.            

That would explain AJ's behaviour (loosing temper and slapping) much
more than anything else. If he had been totally secure, I am sure he 
would have handled it quite differently.      

But, being a professional, he made the most of it, and his sponsors
cannot have been completely dissatisfied.    

Reputedly (this made it all the way into the Swedish television!) AJ
also apologized afterwards. 

To make this slightly 944 oriented, bring this scene along to the next
time you race. Man is a very competitive animal, and our instincts and
reactions may work (just) when competing face to face, naked... Armed
with 944:s it's another thing.   

Regards!

Two part question. First is there a way to get the falt codes out of the
DME, If so how and where do I find what the codes mean. Second question,
Now that is getting hot I have noticed that my fans only come on on low
speed but the temp gauge shows the temp just at the start of the red
mark. The other day the fans finally came on on high speed but the temp
gauge was way into the red even at this high temp? The car has never
boiled over. Does anyone have any ideas? Is there a way to check The
gauge to see if it is reading correctly? Please help!! Please E-mail me
directly sometimes I get the digest sometimes I dont.
Thanks!

There is a slot for the wear indicator, but there is a much more
important slot missing. Farzaan pointed out that Metal masters lack the
vent channel usually found on brake pads. It is the narrow slot that is
cut in the middle of the pad. It is, however, easy to correct. Two hack
saw blades mounted in paralell will make a nice vent channel, as will a
few minutes with the edge of a thin flat file. 

As for discs, opinions vary. I have had good results with turning,
others have not. 

One theory is that used and turned discs may be 'more' resistent to
warping than new ones, as possible stress has been relieved by using
them. 

Are you sure that the lip is for real and not just burnished rust. If
its rust, it can (must) be peened away. There may also be a 'lip' in the
center of the disc, check that too. 

If it really is a protruding lip, the disc is probably worn very close
to limits anyway and turning may be impossible even if it is serviceable
(just). If you choose to use it, just chamfer the edges of the pad, so
it will wear in to the lip easily.   

New pads on old discs need somewhat longer break in than on new discs.

Does anyone know what is up with the 'official' Mobil Oil Corp. web
address?  I have tried several times to get e-mail through to them with no
luck.  Does anyone know if they changed from   xyzabc@mobil.com   (the xyz
being the section of the page you are responding to, i.e. lubes@mobil.com).
 ??

Hi Paul.  I had this problem with my 911.  I bet the 944's are similar.  =
In my case, it was the wiper switch on the column.  When you put the =
lever in the stop position, there is contact made that "tells" the =
wipers to park.  Try gently pushing the lever further in the off =
direction.  This might be enough to touch the contacts.  It worked for =
me, and tipped me off to the problem.

I was able to fix the switch.  You might be able to gently bend the =
contacts so they touch.  In my case I had to glue a little piece of =
plastic onto the cam that pushes the contacts together.  After 90K =
miles, it had worn some.

The intermittent position not working is probably related to the off =
contacts.  Sounds like the 944 has the intermittent on the same lever as =
the wiper on/off, rather than a separate knob like our 911s?  Still, if =
the off contacts aren't made, the intermittent feature will think the =
wipers are on, and not work.

Hope this helps.  BTW, all this talk about 951s and 968s has me curious =
to try one too.  Don't think I could get rid of my Targa, though.=20

Yep I totally agree, when I spent some time sitting in the 1996 993 the
above comments also came to mind. Anything less than a 350 hp 911 Turbo
will not get me interested.

Hi Nick, just to remind you I'm using the B&B carbon-fiber muffler with a
custom bent 3" pipe from the cat-back. It's definitely nasty sounding, I
would'nt want it any louder though. Sets off car alarms very easily. Mine
came with the car, next time I would probably go to a bigger (quieter)B&B
muffler.

Hey Farzaan,

How about some wingtip tanks, an afterburner and an ejection seat (if you
burn into the corners too fast)!  That ought to make it unique!
