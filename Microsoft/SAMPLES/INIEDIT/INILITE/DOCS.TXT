Description:
    WritePrivateProfileStringEx is an extension to WritePrivateProfileString
    The additional feature is that you can add duplicate keys. 

Parameters
    LPSTR lpszFileName
        Fully qualified file name. This filename should be in ANSI.

    LPSTR lpszSection
        Zero terminated string containing the name of the section to 
        which the string should be added. If the section does not exist,
        a new one will be created if the WPPSE_CREATE_SECTION flag is set.

    LPSTR lpszKey
        Zero terminated string containing the name of the key to 
        add. If the key exists, and if WPPSE_ALLOW_DUPES flag
        is specified, it will be added all the same.

    LPSTR lpszValue 
        Zero terminated string containing the name of the value to 
        attach to the key

    UINT uiFlags 
        Any of the following:
        WPPSE_ALLOW_DUPES     - Allow duplicate keys
  
        WPPSE_CREATE_SECTION  - Create a new section if the specified
                                section does not exist

Return
     TRUE  - If the string was written successfully
     FALSE - The string was not added. The function can fail for the
             following reasons:
                 o if the lpszFileName or the lpszSection or the lpszKey
                   is invalid.
                 o Adding the new key made the INIFile greater than
                   64K
                 o if the key is a duplicate and WPPSE_ALLOW_DUPES was
                   not specified
                 o if the section did not exist and WPPSE_CREATE_SECTION
                   was not specified.
                 o If the file could not be opened
                 o Global space could not be allocated for internal 
                   structures
