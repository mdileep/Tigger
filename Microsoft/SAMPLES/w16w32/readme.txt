
    W16W32.MAK is a makefile 'include' that allows easy development of
    single source Win16/Win32 executables.

    You can treat this file somewhat like a .H file.  It is generic
    enough that most projects can include it without modification.

    The end of the file there are two 'sample' makefiles, one for a DLL 
    and one for an EXE.

    NOTE:   This thing is 'Early Beta Quality'.  In otherwords, I'm
            still working on it.  I have not been able to test
            if it works correctly on MIPS.

            If you start using this thing PLEASE keep me posted
            on any changes you make!

            Thanks, charlie
