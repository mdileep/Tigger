                   WINTIME - Windows Time Functions

History

03/13/91 - Minor changes and some documentation.

03/15/91 - Previous version would gp fault if sLongDate did not have
           single quotes around the separator strings.  Control Panel
           always writes with the quotes, but some other application
           appears to be modifying this string and does not add the
           quotes.  The WININI2.TXT documents sLongDate as not having
           quotes, so this should have been done in the first place
           anyway.

12/02/91 - Re-wrote LongDate formatting code after discovering major
           bugs in previous version.  Some contries simply were not
           being formatted correctly.  

*********************************************************************

This article describes a set of functions that are available in
the Software Library for formatting time and date strings using
the international settings in the Windows 3.0 Control Panel.

Windows 3.0 allows the user to specify, via the Control Panel, 
the format of the date and time.  The Windows SDK provides no
functionality for formatting strings according to the Control
Panel's settings.  The 'C' module WINTIME.C provides five 
functions that an application developer can use to format the
date and time.

WINTIME.C was developed to be as flexible and portable as 
possible.  The module can be plugged into an application or
DLL with no modification.

Included with the WINTIME.C file is a sample application that
demonstrates how to use the functions.

The functions provided by WINTIME are documented below:


LPSTR FAR PASCAL TimeGetCurDate( LPSTR lpszDate, WORD wFlags )

  Description:
    Function returns the current date, formatted the way windows
    wants it!
  
  Arguments:
    Type/Name
             Description
  
    LPSTR lpszDate
             Points to a buffer that is to recieve the date.  Must be
             large enough to hold the longest date possible (64 bytes
             should do it).
  
    struct tm *lpTM
             Pointer to a "tm" structure (from time.h) that contains
             the time and date you want formatted.
  
    WORD  wFlags
             Specifies flags that modify the behavior of the function.
             May be any of the following.
  
          Flag              Meaning
          0                 The date will be formatted exactly the way
                            Control Panel does it, using Windows'
                            international settings.  The date will be in
                            the Long Date format (Sunday, January 1, 
                            1991).
  
          DATE_SHORTDATE    Forces the date to be formatted using the
                            Short Date Format (1/01/91).
  
          DATE_NODAYOFWEEK  The date will be formatted without the
                            day of week.  This flag may not be used 
                            with the DATE_SHORTDATE flag.

void FAR PASCAL TimeResetInternational( void ) 

  Description:
    This function sets some local static variables to Windows' current
    time and date settings.

    It should be called everytime a WM_WININICHANGE is sent for the
    intl section and when the DLL or application using these functions
    starts up.

    The variables here are in the DLLs data segment so if one app
    changes the stuff, the others will see it.
