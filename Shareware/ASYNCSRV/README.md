# Windows to CompuServe Shareware Access System

AsyncSrv is a general purpose Asyncrhonous Communications application that has been designed to be used as an interface for Windows applications to dialup services such as CompuSrv. AsyncSrv has only a rudimentary user interface that is intended for debugging purposes only. It's real power comes from it's flexibility and adaptibility to any task.

Applications communicate with AsyncSrv primarily through DDE (Dynamic Data Excange). Unlike most communications applications which are typically DDE clients, AsyncSrv is primarily a DDE server. Client applications submit requests and commands to AsyncSrv, and AsyncSrv carries those request and commands out on the host.

AsyncSrv uses the latest and most advanced Windows communications technology. It is capable of operating at high speeds while allowing your other applications to run at the same time in the foreground.

Kindel Software Systems has developed an asynchronous communications engine for Windows that would serve as the link to CompuServe. The details of the communications engine would be hidden from the user. All the user would be required to do is select a modem type, comm port, baud rate, phone number to dial, CompuServe ID, and password.

The idea for this product was spawned by the creation of the GO SWREG forum on CompuServe. By typing "GO SWREG" while connected to compuserve, users can search for shareware titles, find out where the shareware is on CompuServe, and register titles by having their CompuServe account charged.
