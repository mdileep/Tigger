                Mark 30 was designed to defeat the mechanism 
                within Windows 3.0 that detects Windows 2.x 
                applications.  

                Use with EXTREME care!  Serious data loss 
                could occur if an ill behaved Windows 2.x 
                application crashes under Windows 3.0!!!!

           INTRODUCTION

           Mark30 is a Windows 3.0 utility that marks old
           Windows applications so that they will run under
           Windows 3.0 without the Windows 3.0 warning message.
           This utility does no checking of the application
           being marked, except to verify that it is a Windows
           application.

           There are two flags in the header of a Windows
           executable file (called the "new executable format").
           The memory flag indicates that the application makes
           clean use of memory, thus enabling it to run under
           Windows 3.0 in protected mode.  The font flag
           indicates whether the application can handle the
           proportional system font in Windows 3.0.  Mark30
           allows you to set and unset both of these flags.

           Many Windows 2.x application work fine under Windows
           3.0, but many do not.  If you have a Windows 2.x
           application that works under Windows 3.0, and you are
           tired of the annoying warning message Windows 3.0
           gives you each time you run your program, Mark30 will
           save you.

           IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!
           Just because a Windows 2.x application APPEARS to
           work under Windows 3.0 don't assume it is completely
           compatible, there may be situations where the
           application will fail!!!!


           USAGE

           To use Mark30, simply start it as you would any
           Windows application.  When it starts up you are
           presented with a file selection list box, two check
           boxes, and several buttons.

           Select a file either by typing a name in the edit
           control, or by clicking on a name in the list box.
           You may also change directories and drives as you
           normally would in a Windows application.
           Once you have a file selected, choose the flags you
           want set.  The font flag can only be set if the
           memory flag is set.

           Press the "Mark File" button to mark the application.
           If the application you choose is not a Windows
           application a message box will appear informing you
           of this.  If the application IS a Windows program a
           warning dialog box will appear asking you to confirm
           your choice.

           Once a file is marked, it can be "unmarked" by
           reversing the check boxes.

           That's all there is to it!
