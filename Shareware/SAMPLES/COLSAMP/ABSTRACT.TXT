ABSTRACT
This sample illustrates how to implement OLE Automation Collections using the Microsoft Foundation Classes version 2.5 (MFC 2.5).   The following techniques and features are demonstrated:

 o  Complete application object model:
      Application
      Windows*
      Window*
      Documents*
      Document
      Items
      Item      
      
      *Not implemented yet.

o   Complete implementation of an Automation Collection, including support 
      for the "NewEnum" property through IEnumVARIANT.   

o   The implementation of IEnumVARIANT for the Items collection is a good 
      example of using the MFC 2.5 INTERFACE_MAP macros to add an 
      OLE 2 interface to a given class (as described in MFC 2.5 Technote 38).

o    An MFC 2.5 "Full Server" that supports in-place editing etc... (linking not yet
      implemented).

Also included is the beginning of an article on implementing collections in MFC 2.5 (collect.doc).   This article and sample will someday be submitted to the MSND when complete.

It should be noted that this sample is not completely finished.   It certainly demonstrates the things above, but I have plans to polish it further.
