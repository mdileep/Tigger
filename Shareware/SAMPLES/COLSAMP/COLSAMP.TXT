README for the ColSamp sample application

There are some features of this application that have not been implemented
yet:

o  Much of the 'object model' has not been filled out.  For example
   the only implemented collection is the CItems collection.  'Windows' and
   'Documents' are other collections that need to be implemented.
   
o  Also missing are many automation methods and properties on the
   exisiting objects.  At the top of each .CPP file are notes on which
   methods and properties have been implemented.
   
o  The CColSampSrvrItem implementation currently does not support links to
   either the entire document or to items in it.  
   
o  No code has been written to provide data via IDataObject from the
   server item.
